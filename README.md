# Globie
This repository was established on 7/16/2018 at around 11:30 am for the purpose of creating a side scroll game at my internship (Envoy).

The game is a side scroller game in which a character named "Globie" embarks on an adventure to get his immigration process settled. He must first select the visa type and then go on to collect the documents avoids all the draw backs to submit his application, after which he must finish the last hassle of luck to get his visa.
